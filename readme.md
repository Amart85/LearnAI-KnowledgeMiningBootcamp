# LearnAI: Knowledge Mining Bootcamp - Azure Cogntive Search Solution for business documents

## Build an intelligent search solution  using Microsoft Azure AI Platform

### About this Course

In this course you will create an enterprise search solution by applying knowledge mining to business documents like contracts, memos, presentations and images. You will use Microsoft Azure AI technology to extract insights from unstructured data and expose the results in a Bot interface.

At the end of this training you will have learned:

+ **What** Azure Cognitive Search is
+ **How** to implement a Cognitive Search Solution
+ **Why** this technology can be useful for any company
+ **When** to use this solution for demos, POCs and other business scenarios

The hands-on labs will teach you how to use Microsoft Azure Search combined with Microsoft Cognitive Services for entity recognition, image analysis, text translation and indexed search on enterprise business documents. This approach uses Arificial Intelligence to create an advanced search experience.

While this course focusses on Azure Cognitive Search capabilities, a depth course on building Bots and integrating various cognitive services is available here - [Building Intelligent Agents and Apps](https://azure.github.io/LearnAI-Bootcamp/emergingaidev_bootcamp).

In this course you will learn these key concepts:

1. Fundamentals of Azure Search and its capabilities

1. Understand Microsoft Cognitive Search and its key business scenarios

1. Build an enrichment data pipeline for search using predefined and custom skillsets:

    + Text skills like entity recognition, language detection, text manipulation and key phrase extraction
    + Image skills like OCR
    + Language skills like text translation
    + Content moderation skills to block documents with incompliant content.

1. Use the enriched data for an advanced search experience for business documents within an enterprise.

1. Expose the knowledge mining solution using a bot interface for document search and consumption.
